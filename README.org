* Pong in JS
This JS project uses node and could be hosted on a web server. The code runs on port 3000. git clone it and run node app.js and make sure you installed express.
** Tutorials I used

- I used MDN https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/setLineDash
- StackOverflow had some tips and tricks for fine tuning the AI. The AI is still not good

** TODO List
I will come back to this project and complete it mark my words. However I must move on!!
- [-] Pong [88%]
  - [X] Paddles
  - [X] Ball
  - [X] AI
  - [X] Score
  - [X] Sounds
  - [ ] 2 Players
  I cannot get 2 players working because it's hard to communicate from the html, to the js, to the class of paddle. I need even more modularity to be able to not hard code the keybindings.
